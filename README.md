### Multiple Correction

### Multiple correction, also known as multiple testing correction or multiple comparison correction, is a statistical technique used to adjust for the inflated risk of making Type I errors (false positives) when conducting multiple hypothesis tests simultaneously. When you perform multiple statistical tests on the same dataset or explore multiple hypotheses, the likelihood of at least one test yielding a significant result by chance increases. Multiple correction methods help control this increased risk.

### Multiple statistical tests are performed on same sample.

### when multiple tests are performed on samples or variables for testing differences between these samples and variables. then error may come. Then, we use multiple correction techniques.

### When should multiple correction be used?

### Whenever you have multiple p values for the same purpose.

Benjamini and Hochberg's procedure for multiple correction

When the same samples are compared with multiple tests, correction is done for p values.

The difference between group A and group B is analyzed using 20 variables. That means we are performing 20 tests on the same sample.

Multiple corrections are used to correct P values.
